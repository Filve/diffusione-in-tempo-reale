"""End-to-end test of stopping a job that is generating, on a real sd-server.

It needs a real model: any model the server can load, on any backend. The jobs are small (64x64) and the
ones that get stopped never run to the end, so how long the test takes does not depend on --steps. The
standard library is enough.

  python3 test/server_cancel_e2e.py --server build/bin/sd-server --model /path/to/model.safetensors

Extra options for the server (a backend, --flash-attn, ...) go after --extra, one each, for example
--extra=--flash-attn --extra=on. To use a server that is already running: --url http://127.0.0.1:1234 (add
--api-key if it asks for one); the check of the server log is then skipped. Exit code 0 = all checks passed.

The first generation can take minutes when the weights are read from a slow disk, so the test starts with
a warm-up job (--warmup-timeout) and only then looks at how a stop behaves.

Without ?wait= the cancel route answers at once, with the job still generating, and sends the stop once: the
library forgets a stop that arrives before the generation has begun, so the test asks again when the job does
not end, as a client of the route does. With ?wait=N the server repeats the stop itself and answers 200 when
the job has ended or 202 when it has not.
